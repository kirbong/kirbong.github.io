                <h3>mind stuff</h3>
                <p><time>2024-07-12</time></p>

                <p>originally, this series of posts was going to be titled "hamster food." why? i took inspiration from
                    this meme pictured below. these posts are truly just my mind's <i>stuff</i>, much like hamster food
                    is just <i>stuff</i>.</p>
                <img src="/images/hamster-food.jpg" alt="" width="30%">
                <p><small><i>wise words from tiktok user big beluga</i></small></p>
                <p>"hamster food" didn't seem to fit quite right, though. i have a tote bag, gifted to me by my grandma,
                    that i carry around with me often. i have given her the name "potpourri." this name was given for
                    similar reasons why i would name this "hamster food." she (potpourri, my tote bag) is full of stuff
                    that makes
                    me
                    happy, inspired by the fact that potpourri is really just <i>stuff</i> that <i><b>smells
                            good</b></i>. i
                    have
                    decided
                    to adopt this name for these posts as well.</p>
                <p>"potpourri" is a round up of stuff going on in my life as well as stuff in the world i find
                    fascinating and worth to share. i want to put out a new "potpourri" weekly, but this may change
                    based on my bandwidth. truly, speaking about my life's happenings and my interests is something i
                    find very challenging. therefore, i hope you find value in the stuff shared here!</p>

                <p><b>presentations</b></p>
                <img src="/images/kristen_talks_flyer.png" alt="" width="30%">
                <p>i made an announcement about one of my presentations in a separate blog post, but i am now giving TWO
                    presentations in ONE weekend!</p>
                <p>i am very excited and honored to have been chosen to speak about some of the stuff i make. i am
                    currently in "finishing up presentations" mode, which has taken up most of my recent time.</p>
                <p><b>queer joy jam: polly heart, mall mop</b></p>
                <p>alongside the presentations, i have been working with some friends on making a submission for the <a
                        href="https://itch.io/jam/queerjoyjam2024" target="_blank">queer joy jam</a>!</p>
                <p>our idea is titled "polly heart: mall mop." it is a 2d sidescroller where you play as a queer
                    character who tries to shoplift the most joyous and affirming outfit you can from the mall.
                    alongside the stealth element of the sidescroller, players can play dress up with some of the
                    clothes
                    from their heist at the end of the game!</p>
                <p><b>clown egg</b></p>
                <p>it was exciting to find out that the <a href="https://www.clownsinternational.com/egg-registry/"
                        target="_blank">clowns international egg registry</a> does not need
                    one to be of active clown status to submit to them. you just need a unique clown persona to submit
                    pictures of and pay a membership fee.</p>
                <p>i have now made it my mission to be able to confidently say that <i>i</i> have a registered clown
                    egg. i am creating a clown persona inspired by 90s whimsigoth aesthetics. it is currently a work in
                    progress, you can see a <i>very rough</i> sketch here. my tentative clown name is twinkles. :)</p>
                <img src="/images/clown_sketch.png" alt="" width="30%">
                <p><b>you are so loved.</b></p>
                <img src="/images/love_letter.png" alt="" width="40%">
                <p>i think often of those who feel lost in this world. maybe as you read this, you think this is crazy,
                    but i wish i could tell these people that the world loves them. <i>i</i> love them, and that
                    they are
                    needed. i have never once thought that the scarcity of love is what makes it meaningful. i feel like
                    love just pours out of my heart, and i need somewhere to express it. what better way to send my
                    message than through a love letter to the masses?</p>
                <p>"you are so loved" is a love letter inspired augmented reality project i am currently working on. it
                    is rather simple in its implementation; i will be posting the above qr code as a sticker that links
                    to a <a href="https://youaresoloved.marcinek.tech/" target="_blank">subpage of my website</a> which
                    depicts a 3d model of the message that i created with blender. i am in the midst of making sure the
                    model
                    formats well to all screens as well as polishing the front-end.</p>

                <h3>üå± sprouts from my mind garden</h3>
                <p><b>kaiju psychological horror game</b></p>
                <p><b>what is intelligence if not just efficiency?</b></p>
                <p>there are many ways the word "intelligence" is defined, and many different contexts for its use
                    exist. when i ponder on what intelligence is, really, my context is the rudimentary concept of being
                    "smarter than."</p>
                <p>if two people can solve the same math problem with the same accuracy, but one
                    finishes it faster than the other, the one who finishes faster would commonly be regarded as
                    "smarter." why, though? at the end of the day, they both finished the problem correctly. therefore,
                    does the swiftness in
                    which one solves a problem have weight on how intelligent they are? does this not indicate that
                    intelligence in the end is not just efficiency?</p>
                <p>this is something i would like to explore further. i am sure there must be others who have not only
                    asked this question, but answered it. this truly exists as a sprout, currently. i wonder about a
                    world where "intelligence"
                    may be interpreted differently without the context of capitalism and its unrealistic hyper-focus on
                    human
                    productivity.</p>
                <p><b>10 year gamergate retrospective</b></p>
                <p>this august will be 10 years from the beginnings of the gamergate saga. gamergate started when i was
                    14, and it subsequently "ended" when i was about 15 or 16. a child, really. i was <i>incredibly</i>
                    passionate about speaking out against gamergate and in support of the likes of zoe quinn and anita
                    sarkeesian, especially. gamergate had a significant impact on my worldview at the time; so much so
                    that i presented a research poster on it for a community college anthropology course i was taking my
                    junior year of high school.</p>
                <p>a post coming up soon will be a retrospective on the sociopolitical landscape in games at that time
                    through my now 24 year old, more educated perspective. i will also be releasing a review of the game
                    that (kind of,
                    sort of) started it all, depression quest.</p>
                <p><b>the faux tension of empathy and sympathy</b></p>
                <p>i often find the debate surrounding the meaningfulness of sympathy vs empathy, and especially the
                    opinion that empathy is inherently more meaningful, to be too black and white. something i ponder on
                    is, is empathy not just heightened centering of the self? is it not <i>more</i> brave to admit to
                    someone you have
                    no idea what they're going through, no way of feeling what they are feeling, yet you still feel
                    <i>for</i> them? how exactly can one discern the difference between feeling <i>for</i> someone
                    opposed to feeling <i>with</i> someone, and why do we perceive one as more empty, and often further,
                    more
                    condescending, than the other? are we not creating a dichotomy where one does not need to exist?
                    this is an idea i want to explore further, especially within the
                    context of empathy-fueled serious games. if anyone has recommendations for literature on this,
                    please feel free to share! i want to gather informed perspectives wherever i can.
