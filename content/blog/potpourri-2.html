                <p>so yeah, this fell through the cracks a little bit already. you can't blame me! i had a game jam
                    submission, two back to back presentations, and a wonderful surprise visit from a wonderful friend.
                    i am sad such an eventful weekend is now over, but i am also happy to be getting back on track.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>slapping on the bow</h3>
                <p><b>presentations</b></p>
                <p>the weekend of talks went incredibly well! both of my presentations garnered immense interest, and i
                    have now made some really cool connections through them.</p>
                <p>the creative coding fest workshop recording is not yet available to the public. i will link/upload it
                    as soon as i am notified that it is!</p>
                <p>if you would like to watch my maker talk, you can see the recording of the livestream <a

                <p>i will also have a separate page linking the slides for both, as well as a zine of the contents of
                    the maker talk for download!</p>
                <p>and special shout-out to one of my best friends, ellie, for surprising me and attending the talk! i
                    was genuinely so surprised that i questioned if my nerves could <i>really</i> make me hallucinate
                    her presence.</p>

                <p>as game jams go, there were issues with the build, not all of the art was completed, we all got burnt
                    out at the end, etc..... i do not say this in a defeatist way. not being hard on oneself for missing
                    self-imposed, recreational deadlines is a standard i will always uphold. this experience was super
                    freaking fun; the team i worked with was so amazingly talented, and i look forward to pushing the
                    game through the finish line with them in the upcoming weeks!!! stay tuned!!!</p>
                <p><b>japan-us careers webinar</b></p>
                <p>i attended a webinar last week that was a collaboration between the embassy of japan and kizuna
                    across cultures. it was a discussion on how americans can pursue careers in japan, or even pursue
                    careers in the united states that deal with us-japan relations.</p>
                <p>my study abroad this year has empowered me to actually consider a career abroad, and finding
                    opportunities such as this helps me get further with that goal. i will list some of the resources
                    the panelists recommended below!</p>

                <h3>creatin'</h3>
                <p><b>live coding dungeon synth with a vocaloid choir</b></p>
                <p>some friends of mine are hosting an algorave in october (details about how to particpate below).</p>
                <p>i like electronic music, but it is not something i envision creating. i do not know why, exactly,
                    just doesn't feel like <i>me</i>, whatever that means.</p>
                <p>therefore, i thought of what other music genres can be recreated in code. music genres that are synth
                    heavy and/or usually electronically produced would be easiest to live code (yes, obviously these
                    would still be under the
                    electronic umbrella). that is where i came up
                    with the idea to livecode dungeon synth.</p>
                <p>i have been downloading samples of wacky retro synths & orchestral instruments to implement in <a
                        href="https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot" target="_blank">foxdot</a>. i
                    chose foxdot because it is python, and it also has <a href="https://www.sinsy.jp/"
                        target="_blank">sinsy.jp</a> integration, which is an open source vocaloid program. i plan on
                    using sinsy to have a "choir" singing effect, like many fantasy instrumentals do.</p>
                <p><b>us-japan relations in gaming</b></p>
                <p>usually, i denote economics as the straight guy's version of astrology (/hj). who knew that i would
                    be
                    becoming more and more invested in its inner workings?</p>
                <p>i have fell down a research rabbithole of tensions and competition between american and japanese
                    gaming companies, and the implications of this rivalry for larger economic security collaboration. i
                    will be turning some of this research into a publication, hopefully coming soon.</p>
                <p>if you are interested in learning more about us-japan economic security relations more broadly, i
                    recommend checking out <a
                        href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/reshaping-us-japan-economic-security-partnership-indo-pacific"

                <p><b>psyche quest</b></p>
                <p><a href="https://marcinexus.itch.io/psyche-quest" target="_blank">psyche quest</a> is one of the
                    projects that i am most proud of, though it has not yet reached the potential i believe it has. i am
                    going to be re-working the level design to be longer & more intuitive, flesh out the narrative, do
                    further research on bpd to include in the game, and adding all of the standard menus, settings, save
                    states, etc. over the next few months.</p>
                <p>psyche quest has only been made possible by the efforts of my classmate, sara, who worked with me on
                    this tirelessly for a midterm project for one of our courses last year. thank you, sara!</p>

                <h3>üå± sprouts from my mind garden</h3>
                <p><b>kaiju psychological horror game</b></p>
                <p><i>what makes a <b>god</b>? how does a god become forgotten? how would one overcome <b>a forgotten
                            god‚Äôs wrath</b>?</i></p>
                <p>i think cthulhu was the first kaiju. no, really, not even king kong. (or, okay, maybe biblically
                    accurate angels were or something). there are too many similarities
                    between the role godzilla plays in his early films and cthulhu. i believe there is a lot of
                    untapped potential in the kaiju genre for cosmic & psychological horror elements because of this
                    comparison.</p>
                <p>i am currently ideating on a psychological horror game about a sole survivor of a kaiju attack who
                    must find their way back to their loved ones through piecing together memories of their life that
                    were
                    wiped away through injury. this is a rather intense premise, and thus would have a very intensive
                    development process, especially since i would envision such a game as a first-person 3d experience.
                    because of this, this is mostly a sprout until i have the bandwidth to seriously consider
                    development.</p>
                <p><b>temporary tattoos</b></p>
                <p>when thinking on pervasive games, i like to consider the roles of "the person" and "the body" as
                    actors within a space. what is a way to (ethically) integrate "the body" into pervasive play?</p>
                <p>in taking the playful cities course, i thought temporary tattoos would be an interesting way to
                    explore this idea. i considered using them as tattooable qr codes that would start a <a
                        href="https://www.hivemechanic.org/" target="_blank">hive
                        mechanic</a> session. unfortunately, this was an idea that i did not get to explore but would
                    definitely like to further.</p>
                <p><b>technology as a metaphor for the body (and the body informing technology?)</b></p>
                <p>on a tangential note to the sprout above, i have also been inspired by ali na's work, <a
                        href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2017.1298143" target="_blank"><i>the
                            fetish of the click: a small history of the computer mouse as vulva</i></a>. i am thinking
                    of other ways in which technology mirrors the analog, biological human experience, especially
                    regarding "the body."</p>
                <p>this has been massively inspirational in some of the ideas for further artwork i am exploring. these
                    sprouts are not even sprouts, just seeds, so i will share more on my ideas as i flesh them out!</p>
                <p><b>syllabus project</b></p>
                <p>instagram has allowed me to stumble into the <a href="https://syllabusproject.org/"
                        target="_blank">syllabus project</a>. i <i>love</i> learning, and i <i>love</i> teaching, so i
                    am
                    thinking of a syllabus idea to propose. i am trying to think of the wackiest, weirdest game
                    design-based syllabus as possible that would also have a worthwhile impact, of course. stay tuned to
                    see where i go with this!</p>
