                <h1>welcome to my site!</h1>
                <p>if you know me in real life, you know that i continue to espouse the sentiment that i am finishing up
                    my portfolio site. well, that's sort of the case..... i decided to revamp it through hosting it on
                    github pages again. while i liked the ease of use of adobe portfolio, the features were not
                    conducive to where i wanted to take my site and would often leave me too frustrated to be motivated
                    to make it work.</p>
                <p>marcinek.tech is not just a portfolio site, but it is also a page where one can glimpse into more
                    personal interests of mine. you may see this as a mistake, and that is valid, but i often denote the
                    idea of "personal" vs "professional" to be too rigid of boundaries. the phrase "be the change you
                    want to see in the world" comes to mind. if i don't act in such a way that (respectfully) pushes the
                    barriers of social norms, who am i to complain about them?</p>
                <p>a major inspiration for the direction of this site came from friends and colleagues whom i have met
                    in person who are
                    also interested in creative technology. likewise, the <a
                        href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival"
                        target="_blank">web revival</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank">indieweb</a>
                    movements are of
                    great interest to me. i won't reveal the url, but i was a rather early adopter of neocities! lastly,
                    i have been going through mark fisher's <a href="https://k-punk.org/" target="_blank">k-punk</a>
                    archives as well as
                    <a href="https://theresalduncan.typepad.com/" target="_blank">the wit of the staircase</a> by
                    theresa duncan. two geniuses in their respective disciplines gone too soon, both with blogs a part
                    of their legacies.
                </p>
                <p>on this site, you will see an archive of some of my best and/or favorite works in game design,
                    computational art, and immersive media. this site <b>is my
                        portfolio first and foremost.</b> most of the other topics on here are related to my
                    professional interests. this blog won't be about the meals i had today, for example. i also feel the
                    need to reiterate my footer disclaimer: while i am proud of, grateful for, and identify with my
                    employment history, all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own. they are not representative of
                    the wilson center, national children's museum, american university, or rutgers university.</p>
                <p>a core tenet of mine is there is something to be learned from everyone. i write not as an authority,
                    but as an equal. this is not to say i have no expertise on the matters i write about, quite the
                    opposite, nor is it an
                    excuse for me to portray narratives that are uninformed. rather, it is a reminder that the lens in
                    which i write is ultimately just that of another person. a valuable lens, a lens which attempts to
                    ground itself in tangible realities outside of me, but still my own, not free from bias or
                    egocentrism.</p>
                <p>i hope you enjoy your stay! this website is currently still under construction. i am having some
                    continued issues with using the bootstrap 5 stylesheet. you may also click on a lot of dead or
                    broken links. adding more things as i go!</p>

            <title>connecting intriguing theory and practice</title>
            <link>https://marcinek.tech/content/blog/connecting-theory.html</link>

                <h1>connecting intriguing theory and practice</h1>
                <h3>what are the common themes in inspiration for my work?</h3>
                <p><time>2024-07-06</time></p>

                <img src="/images/theory-mind-map.jpg" alt="" width="65%">
                <p><small><i>mind map created in miro</i></small></p>

                <p>recently, i have been indulging in a lot of research around social theory to inform my praxis and
                    practice. while much of my focus has been on topics that i've engaged with prior, i wanted to dive
                    more
                    deeply to create a personal framework of expertise.</p>
                <p>the topics i am currently surrounding myself with include ludology, marxism, playful design,
                    nostalgia, cyberfeminism, absurdism, existentialism, and surrealism. all topics one may think have
                    little in common. in a lot of my research, it has come to light to me that it is quite the
                    contrary, and thus, the map above was born.</p>
                <p>through reading mary flanagan's essay "locating play and politics: real world games & activism" this
                    past semester, i have come rather enamored not just with the idea of pervasive games, immersion & physicality,
                    and stretching the boundaries of the magic circle, but with an unexpected, briefly discussed portion of this article: situationist international and guy
                    debord.</p>
                <p>mark fisher is a rather hot name amongst gen z social theorists - for good reason. his expansion of
                    hauntology resonates with the recent y2k-era (late 90s to early 2010s) nostalgia many 20-somethings
                    are facing right now. finding mark fisher's involvement
                    with sadie plant, who like mary flanagan conducts research on cyberfeminism and situationist
                    international, was rather intriguing. from what i have found so far, sadie plant and mary flanagan
                    have not had any direct collaboration, though.</p>
                <p>like jean-paul sartre and his attempts to rectify marxist ideals with existentialist beliefs, i often
                    find myself grappling with similar. can certain schools of thought coexist, or further, inform one
                    another? many marxists believe existentialism is inherently incompatible with marxism. like sartre,
                    i
                    must disagree, and i think situationist international and their absurdist motifs may disagree as
                    well. the lack of an ability to rectify the differences is an interesting line of thinking to consider given that marx was majorly influenced by hegel,
                    whose dialectics have proven to be paramount to my readings of philosophy, at least.</p>
                <p>what do you think of my connections? am i sensing patterns where patterns may not belong?</p>

                <p><i>okay, maybe press is <b>too</b> official of a word, here.</i> maybe this should actually be titled
                    "recent

                <p><b>full disclosure:</b> speaking about my accomplishments is always a very <i>strange</i> thing for
                    me to balance properly. often, i find
                    myself not wanting to accidentally come off as arrogant so much that i simply do not really mention
                    what
                    goes on in my life. perhaps a bad approach, especially because when <i>i do</i> tell people about
                    myself or my work, it tends to be surprising. maybe a list format doesn't help the "bomb drop"
                    approach!</p>
                <p>likewise, there is the possibility i should worry less about coming off as arrogant. all i can do is
                    try my best to be my authentic self; that's all we can ask of anyone.</p>

                <p><b><i>vulnerability</i></b></p>
                <p>i think the world would be better if we allowed each other space for open dialogue. what could be
                    imagined, even accomplished, if we not only didn't shame others, but also didn't shame ourselves?
                </p>
                <p>this piece of creative non-fiction, titled "dialectics," comes from my archive of writings.
                    definitely a more <i>vulnerable</i> piece of work. it also happens to be one of my favorites. it has
                    a less "academic" context attached to it than most of my other writings here will have.</p>
                <p>hegelian dialectics are paramount for my understanding of the world. it is interwoven within the
                    fabric of existence; there is too much complexity in the world for absolute, innate truth to exist.
                    hope you enjoy!

                <p>i find myself caught within the crossfire of two persistent truths.</p>
                <p>my gram once told me, “the most intelligent people are the saddest, and there was a sadness in you
                    that i felt deeply.” i often regard myself as someone whose eyes are open to the world and its
                    horrors, and i don’t know if i can ever go back. the world is brimming with sorrow. how can i not
                    see it? how can i not feel it?</p>
                <p>yet in me i find the optimist. the person my mom would always quip that “she never cried when she
                    fell.” i’d simply get back up and try walking again. i’d never go back to just crawling like the
                    other babies. the person who laughs at her own jokes so hard she can never just spit them out, who
                    adores saturation and vibrancy.</p>
                <p>can these two truths coexist in some twisted semblance of harmony? or will they always be battling to
                    defeat each other, one eventually succeeding with the other lost to time, only existing in a former
                    self?</p>
                <p>i consider that maybe they stem from the same virtue. could it be that the world is just so
                    beautiful, and i see so much opportunity for everyone and everything? i often denote these truths as
                    my curse—but i know i do not genuinely believe that—i’d take this battle of truths over blissful
                    ignorance in every lifetime.</p>

                <p>is this piece a plea for understanding? is it too self-congratulatory? well, if we take my own
                    mindset into consideration, these interpretations can co-exist. thank you for reading.</p>

                <h1>potpourri no.1</h1>
                <h3>mind stuff</h3>
                <p><time>2024-07-12</time></p>

                <p>originally, this series of posts was going to be titled "hamster food." why? i took inspiration from
                    this meme pictured below. these posts are truly just my mind's <i>stuff</i>, much like hamster food
                    is just <i>stuff</i>.</p>

                <p>"hamster food" didn't seem to fit quite right, though. i have a tote bag, gifted to me by my grandma,
                    that i carry around with me often. i have given her the name "potpourri." this name was given for
                    similar reasons why i would name this "hamster food." she (potpourri, my tote bag) is full of stuff
                    that makes
                    me
                    happy, inspired by the fact that potpourri is really just <i>stuff</i> that <i><b>smells
                            good</b></i>. i
                    have
                    decided
                    to adopt this name for these posts as well.</p>
                <p>"potpourri" is a round up of stuff going on in my life as well as stuff in the world i find
                    fascinating and worth to share. i want to put out a new "potpourri" weekly, but this may change
                    based on my bandwidth. truly, speaking about my life's happenings and my interests is something i
                    find very challenging. therefore, i hope you find value in the stuff shared here!</p>

                <p><b>presentations</b></p>
                <img src="/images/kristen_talks_flyer.png" alt="" width="30%">
                <p>i made an announcement about one of my presentations in a separate blog post, but i am now giving TWO
                    presentations in ONE weekend!</p>
                <p>i am very excited and honored to have been chosen to speak about some of the stuff i make. i am
                    currently in "finishing up presentations" mode, which has taken up most of my recent time.</p>
                <p><b>queer joy jam: polly heart, mall mop</b></p>
                <p>alongside the presentations, i have been working with some friends on making a submission for the <a
                        href="https://itch.io/jam/queerjoyjam2024" target="_blank">queer joy jam</a>!</p>
                <p>our idea is titled "polly heart: mall mop." it is a 2d sidescroller where you play as a queer
                    character who tries to shoplift the most joyous and affirming outfit you can from the mall.
                    alongside the stealth element of the sidescroller, players can play dress up with some of the
                    clothes
                    from their heist at the end of the game!</p>
                <p><b>clown egg</b></p>
                <p>it was exciting to find out that the <a href="https://www.clownsinternational.com/egg-registry/"
                        target="_blank">clowns international egg registry</a> does not need
                    one to be of active clown status to submit to them. you just need a unique clown persona to submit
                    pictures of and pay a membership fee.</p>
                <p>i have now made it my mission to be able to confidently say that <i>i</i> have a registered clown
                    egg. i am creating a clown persona inspired by 90s whimsigoth aesthetics. it is currently a work in
                    progress, you can see a <i>very rough</i> sketch here. my tentative clown name is twinkles. :)</p>
                <img src="/images/clown_sketch.png" alt="" width="30%">
                <p><b>you are so loved.</b></p>
                <img src="/images/love_letter.png" alt="" width="40%">
                <p>i think often of those who feel lost in this world. maybe as you read this, you think this is crazy,
                    but i wish i could tell these people that the world loves them. <i>i</i> love them, and that
                    they are
                    needed. i have never once thought that the scarcity of love is what makes it meaningful. i feel like
                    love just pours out of my heart, and i need somewhere to express it. what better way to send my
                    message than through a love letter to the masses?</p>
                <p>"you are so loved" is a love letter inspired augmented reality project i am currently working on. it
                    is rather simple in its implementation; i will be posting the above qr code as a sticker that links
                    to a <a href="https://youaresoloved.marcinek.tech/" target="_blank">subpage of my website</a> which
                    depicts a 3d model of the message that i created with blender. i am in the midst of making sure the
                    model
                    formats well to all screens as well as polishing the front-end.</p>

                <h3>🌱 sprouts from my mind garden</h3>
                <p><b>what is intelligence if not just efficiency?</b></p>
                <p>there are many ways the word "intelligence" is defined, and many different contexts for its use
                    exist. when i ponder on what intelligence is, really, my context is the rudimentary concept of being
                    "smarter than."</p>
                <p>if two people can solve the same math problem with the same accuracy, but one
                    finishes it faster than the other, the one who finishes faster would commonly be regarded as
                    "smarter." why, though? at the end of the day, they both finished the problem correctly. therefore,
                    does the swiftness in
                    which one solves a problem have weight on how intelligent they are? does this not indicate that
                    intelligence in the end is not just efficiency?</p>
                <p>this is something i would like to explore further. i am sure there must be others who have not only
                    asked this question, but answered it. this truly exists as a sprout, currently. i wonder about a
                    world where "intelligence"
                    may be interpreted differently without the context of capitalism and its unrealistic hyper-focus on
                    human
                    productivity.</p>
                <p><b>10 year gamergate retrospective</b></p>
                <p>this august will be 10 years from the beginnings of the gamergate saga. gamergate started when i was
                    14, and it subsequently "ended" when i was about 15 or 16. a child, really. i was <i>incredibly</i>
                    passionate about speaking out against gamergate and in support of the likes of zoe quinn and anita
                    sarkeesian, especially. gamergate had a significant impact on my worldview at the time; so much so
                    that i presented a research poster on it for a community college anthropology course i was taking my
                    junior year of high school.</p>
                <p>a post coming up soon will be a retrospective on the sociopolitical landscape in games at that time
                    through my now 24 year old, more educated perspective. i will also be releasing a review of the game
                    that (kind of,
                    sort of) started it all, depression quest.</p>
                <p><b>the faux tension of empathy and sympathy</b></p>
                <p>i often find the debate surrounding the meaningfulness of sympathy vs empathy, and especially the
                    opinion that empathy is inherently more meaningful, to be too black and white. something i ponder on
                    is, is empathy not just heightened centering of the self? is it not <i>more</i> brave to admit to
                    someone you have
                    no idea what they're going through, no way of feeling what they are feeling, yet you still feel
                    <i>for</i> them? how exactly can one discern the difference between feeling <i>for</i> someone
                    opposed to feeling <i>with</i> someone, and why do we perceive one as more empty, and often further,
                    more
                    condescending, than the other? are we not creating a dichotomy where one does not need to exist?
                    this is an idea i want to explore further, especially within the
                    context of empathy-fueled serious games. if anyone has recommendations for literature on this,
                    please feel free to share! i want to gather informed perspectives wherever i can.
