                    <img src="/images/me.JPG" alt="photo of me playing with electronics" width="45%" height="auto"

                    <h3>artist statement</h3>
                    <p>kristen (she/her) doesn't see the opposition between whimsy and meaning, between serious and
                        play.
                        she could go on a spiel about how other adults lose their sense of wonder, and she's really a
                        kid at
                        heart, but she doesn't actually think that's true. this wonder doesn't seem lost, she believes
                        moreso there just aren't many outlets for adults to feel empowered to play.</p>
                    <p>that's where her work comes in! from video games to immersive media to museum exhibits to toys,
                        kristen creates for a wide audience to feel this empowerment to play.</p>
                    <p>kristen works primarily in a domain she dubs "games and interactive media for social impact."
                        this
                        line of work has many names & offshoots under its umbrella: serious games, meaningful games,
                        games
                        for change, educational games, learning through play... no matter what one may call this domain,
                        it
                        is kristen's specialty. </p>
                    <p>in particular, she focuses on how to properly portray social justice topics through game
                        mechanics
                        and narrative. she is passionate about providing non-traditional educational experiences and
                        accurately representing intersectional and marginalized lenses that are grounded in tangible
                        realities. kristen wants to ensure her games are created with ethics and empathy at the
                        forefront of
                        their design.</p>
                    <p>kristen generally doesn't see entertainment and education in a hierarchy. her designs do not have
                        to
                        prioritize one over the other; she believes that they can work synergistically. she does this
                        through making narrative and game mechanics consistent. she wants the story to resonate with the
                        player through mechanics just as much as it does through the dialogue. <b>kristen specializes in
                            ludonarrative harmony, narrative mechanic design, worldbuilding, and diegesis.</b></p>
                    <p>kristen is currently a student at american university working towards her mfa in games and
                        interactive media with a focus on meaningful games and immersive experiences. she currently
                        interns
                        with the wilson center in washington, dc in their serious games initiative. prior to the wilson
                        center, she interned with the national children’s museum as an exhibits intern. kristen received
                        her
                        ba in information technology and informatics from rutgers university – new brunswick, where she
                        also
                        minored in social justice. during her time at rutgers, she was the president of reproductive
                        health
                        universal taskforce, an organization partnered with the friends of unfpa; the vice president and
                        a
                        founding member of rutgers women’s gaming league; and interned with the new jersey division on
                        women
                        where she performed analysis on legislation surrounding batterer intervention programs and
                        criminal
                        justice reform for incarcerated women in new jersey.</p>
                    <p>kristen's technical skillset outside of narrative design includes unity engine & c# scripting;
                        p5.js;
                        javascript & other webdev technologies like html, css, bootstrap, and php; wysiwyg game engines
                        like construct 3, stencyl, & twine;
                        python, pygame, & ren'py; and git for version control. she also dabbles in <a
                            href="/2d-illustration.html">2d illustration</a>, 3d
                        modeling, ui/ux wireframing, and authoring dialogue.</p>
                    <p>kristen practices collaboration and co-design, strives to approach her work through a
                        human-centered
                        lens, and is a quick learner who wants to solve every problem. kristen knows, though, that not
                        everyone can do everything - what truly makes one wise is admitting that even the most
                        knowledgeable
                        can still learn from others. she sees the world in a dialectic - everyone is doing the best they
                        can
                        in the moment yet can still seek to improve.</p>
                    <p>during her free time, kristen likes to spend time with her cat, go to museums, and play video
                        games. over on her <a href="/blog.html" target="_blank">blog</a>, you can see her esoteric &
                        eccentric thoughts on games, technology, social
                        informatics, visual art, philosophy, and even outer space sometimes.
